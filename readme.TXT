An extension for the popular task management tool Asana. This Extension provides you with time track for your Asana-Tasks.

Some tips:
The Tool will only fetch tasks assigned to you. This is because otherwise you will get tons of tasks you do not need.
An important thing additionally is, that you have to archive your task from your "My Tasks" view.
Otherwise Asana will not recognize this tasks as archived and will fetch it instead.
Maybe this changes in the future, but right now there is a difference between archiving a task in the project view
and your personal task view.

Please remember the Asana Api is not as fast as a Porsche, so take your time when the tool fetches
the data from the servers.
